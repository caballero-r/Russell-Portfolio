# Russell-Portfolio

## Description
My goal with this project was to create a landing page for future employers to see my past work.
I created a code from the beginning and attempted to ensure that all the acceptance criteria below was within my code.
Some challenges I had were getting the "work" section in my code where the projects displayed to be organized as the GIF demo. This proved to be difficult and I required additional help from my fellow classmates and my tutor. 


### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
1. WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
2. WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
3. WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
4. WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
 THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
5. WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
6. WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
